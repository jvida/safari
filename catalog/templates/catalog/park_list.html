            We offer a variety of accommodation which will definitely fulfill your expectations.
            You stay at lodges and tented camps depending on your preference.
            All accommodations have electric lights, battery recharging facilities,
            some have Wi-Fi and swimming pools.
          </p>

            Spending a night in a tent under the starry sky surrounded by wild animals expressing themselves
            with a large variety of different noises can be a magical experience which doesn't fit everyoneÂ´s demand.
            For those who don't delight in camping there is also  another option- safari lodge.
            It is a more luxurious and comfortable way of spending your night,
            in a room with your own bed, shower etc.
            <br>
            Depending on the time of arrival and departure you either spend a night in a hotel or not.
            We will inform you in advance and choose accommodation you would like.

            As far as prices are concerned, they depend on current park entry fees
            which are inconsistent as well as on accommodation you choose.
